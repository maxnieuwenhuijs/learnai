You are building React components for an
  e-learning platform. Use existing patterns from the        
  codebase, shadcn/ui components, and Tailwind CSS. Create   
  pages following the structure in src/pages/ and features in
   src/features/. Always check existing components first to  
  reuse patterns. Use AuthContext and ThemeContext for state.
   Ensure mobile-responsive design with clean white
  backgrounds.
